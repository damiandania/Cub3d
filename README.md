Cub3D is a team project from 42 school where the objective is to create a dynamic 3D maze viewer. Using the **MiniLibX** library, the project implements raycasting, inspired by the classic **Wolfenstein 3D** gameâ€”considered the first true first-person shooter (FPS) in video game history.

## Features

- **Raycasting**: Implements raycasting to render a 3D view from a 2D map.
- **MiniLibX**: Utilizes the MiniLibX library for graphics rendering.
- **Dynamic Maze Viewer**: Allows users to navigate through a 3D maze.
